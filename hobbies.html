&nbsp;
<p> Growing up I've always loved writing whether it be writing in my journal, writing short stories or writing essays for class assignments. My passion for writing increased after taking journalism courses in college, where I got to write different types of articles such as academic hard new stories and more creative, magazine-style articles.</p>
<h1> 2) Playing Violin </h1>
